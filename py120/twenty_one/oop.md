Twenty-one is a card game with a dealer and a player
The participants try to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
The game starts by dealing cards from a 52-card deck consisting of cards from 4 suits of 13 ranks
each.
Both participants receive two cards.
    - The dealer hides one of his cards (places it face-down) so that the player can't see what it is.
    - The player can see both of her cards.

The player takes the first turn, and can hit or stay.
- If the player hits, she gets another card, and again has the opportunity to hit(get another card) or stay.
- If the player goes over 21 points, she busts.
- IF the player stays, the dealer plays next.

If the player didn't bust, it's not the dealer's turn.
- The dealer reveals his face-down card.
- If the dealer's total points are less than 17, he must hit and receive another card.
- If the dealer goes over 21 points, he busts.
- If the dealer has 17 points or more, he must stay.
