Approach to OOP:
1. Write a textual description of the problem or exercise
2. Extract the major nouns and verbs from the description
3. Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns.
4. The nouns are the classes and the verbs are the behaviors or methods.


Rock Paper Scissors is a two-player game where each player chooses one of three 
possible moves: rock, paper, scissors. The chosen moves will then be compared
to see who wins, according to the following rules:

If the players choose the same move, then it's a tie.
