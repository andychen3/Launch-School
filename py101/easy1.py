# just the odd numbers?

# Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount and a tip rate.

# Write a function that takes two strings as arguments, determines the length of the two strings,

# Write a function that takes any year greater than 0 as input and returns True if the year is a leap year, or False if it is not.

# For simplicity, this exercise assumes that the Gregorian calendar has been in continuous use since the year 1. We'll address that assumption in the next exercise that follows this one.

# To determine whether a given year is a leap year, use the rules of the Gregorian calendar:

# If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
# If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
# If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year.
# All other years are not leap years.

#     if year % 400:
#         return True
#     elif year % 100:
#         return False
#     else:
#         return year % 4 == 0

# Write a function that computes the sum of all numbers between 1 and some other number, 
# inclusive, that are multiples of 3 or 5. For instance, if the supplied number is 20, 
# the result should be 98 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20).
# You may assume that the number passed in is an integer greater than 1.

# Write a function that determines and returns the UTF-16 string value of a string
#  passed in as an argument. The UTF-16 string value is the sum of the UTF-16 values of 
# every character in the string. (You may use ord to determine the UTF-16 value of a character.)

# def utf16_value(string):
#     total = 0

#     for char in string:
#         total += ord(char)
#     return total

# print(utf16_value('a') == 97)
